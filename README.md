**Security Considerations:**
Ethical Usage: Ensure that you have explicit permission before using these tools on any network or system.
Brute Force Attacks: Be aware that brute-forcing login forms could lock accounts or disrupt services. Always use with caution.
Error Handling: Add proper exception handling, especially for network-related operations.

**Future Enhancements:**
Extended Modules: You can extend the toolkit with additional modules like vulnerability scanners, SQL injection tests, or web scraping tools.
Multithreading/Concurrency: Implement multithreading or asynchronous programming for faster scanning and attacks.
GUI: If you prefer a graphical interface, you could integrate the toolkit with libraries like Tkinter or PyQt5.
Logging and Reporting: Implement logging for the tests performed, including timestamps and results.
