**Task :** Penetration Testing Tool kit

**Intern ID :** CT08DAV

**Key Features:**
Port Scanner: Scans open ports on a target machine.
Brute Forcer: Attempts to brute-force login credentials on a website.
Service Version Detection: Detects the version of services running on open ports.
Modular Design: Each module is self-contained, making it easier to extend and maintain.
CLI Interface: Easy-to-use command-line interface for running the different modules

**Security Considerations:**
Ethical Usage: Ensure that you have explicit permission before using these tools on any network or system.
Brute Force Attacks: Be aware that brute-forcing login forms could lock accounts or disrupt services. Always use with caution.
Error Handling: Add proper exception handling, especially for network-related operations.

**Future Enhancements:**
Extended Modules: You can extend the toolkit with additional modules like vulnerability scanners, SQL injection tests, or web scraping tools.
Multithreading/Concurrency: Implement multithreading or asynchronous programming for faster scanning and attacks.
GUI: If you prefer a graphical interface, you could integrate the toolkit with libraries like Tkinter or PyQt5.
Logging and Reporting: Implement logging for the tests performed, including timestamps and results.
